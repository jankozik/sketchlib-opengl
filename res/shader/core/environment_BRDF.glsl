/* the approximated 2D LUT only depends on two parameters: roughness and the cosine term.
   that is, given a roughness level, we only care about the cosine's value, or the angle
   between N and L, rather than the exact vectors. So, for convenience, we can assume N
   to be a constant vector `vec3(0, 0, 1)`, and confine V to the X-Z plane (V.y = 0), so
   for each input cosine, we can find a unique V on the half circle `x^2 + z^2 = 1` that
   satisfies `dot(N, V) = NoV`, this will also give us L once we have the half vector H.
   the idea of this assumption is to keep all vectors in tangent space, since there's no
   texture lookup operation involved, there's no need to convert them to world space, as
   long as all angles are measured in the same reference frame, the result won't change.

   note that we need to properly handle the edge cases when cosine or roughness is close
   to zero so as to reduce artifacts on the borders: if cosine = 0, vectors N and V will
   be orthogonal to each other which could cause problems, so we clamp `NoV` to 0.0001.
   on the other hand, when roughness is 0, GGX importance sampling will return a halfway
   vector H that overlaps with N, this can lead to precision errors when we calculate L,
   to solve this issue, we must either clamp roughness, or use the `precise` qualifier.

   also note that we are using `NoV` instead of `NoL` as the cosine term in the integral
   seeing L needs to be derived from V and H. In practice, `NoV, NoL, HoV` and `HoL` are
   all very close angles so can be used interchangeably w/o adding noticeable errors.
